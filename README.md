# Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
This project is part of the well-known Kaggle competition, "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". The primary goal is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and can be found on the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition page. It includes passenger information like age, fare, class, and whether or not they survived the disaster.

Approach
The project involves several key steps:

Data Loading: The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation.
Feature Selection: Only numerical features are initially selected for simplicity. This includes features like age, fare, and class.
Handling Missing Values: The dataset contains missing values, which are handled by imputation. Different strategies like mean, median, or mode imputation are explored to fill in these gaps.
Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier is used to train the model. This choice is based on the classifier's effectiveness for a wide range of data types and its robustness to overfitting.
Prediction & Evaluation: The model is then used to predict survival on the test dataset. The performance can be evaluated using various metrics, though the primary metric in the Kaggle competition is accuracy.
Usage
To use this project:

Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.
Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and model parameters to improve the accuracy.
